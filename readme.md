I wont lie this one also sucked, atleast there was no time pressure like the last one but it wasnt good. step 5 was just me throwing stuff at a wall till it stuck. Did it work? i think? tbh, im too tired to know if everything is 200% to what was asked but i think its good enough for now. Please feel free to message me at any time using my email: johnplopez123@gmail.com or through Github. Thank you!
